# Introduction

## What is an open data standard?

An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of an open data set. By putting these rule in place, it means that people and organisations who are publishing data about the same thing, can use the same language to talk about the thing. This means that someone can read about the standard, and then use the data that is published to that standard. It makes it a lot easier to reuse data that has been published, and is especially useful for using data that is published by lots of different people, to make a bigger dataset with more coverage.

## What is the HWRC open data standard?

This household waste recycling centre (HWRC) open data standard is a standard which describes information about HWRCs, and is being designed to provide guidance to local authorities on publishing data about HWRCs. Data such as opening times, the services that are offered by a HWRC A data standard makes data better for users, because it means that different publishers, with different data capture and publishing systems, can publish data in the same format. This means it is much easier to stick two publisher's datasets together. If everyone publishes their data to the standard, then it is theoretically possible to have a dataset that covers the whole of the UK. This dataset could then be used to power a Where's My Nearest Recycling Centre app, or support time-to-travel analyses for recycling centres.

The standard is being developed according to the Open Stand principles of:

* Due process
* Broad consensus
* Transparency
* Balance
* Openness
