# Key Concepts

## HWRCs

A HWRC is a household waste recycling centre, and is a place where residents can take household waste to be disposed of or recycled. Each local authority area has a legal responsibility to provide this service to residents, and the service is usually provided in multiple sites across the local authority area. 

## Owner

The owner of a HWRC is usually the Local Authority that the site is located within. Owners have a legal responsibility to provide household recycling services to its residents.

## Operators

The operator of a HWRC is the organisation responsible for the day-to-day management of the site. This could be the local authority, a different local authority, another not-for-profit organisation, or a private company.

## Services offered

Services offered by HWRCs will differ across sites. Some may offer battery recycling, for example, while other may not. It's important for residents to know which services are offered by HWRCs in their local area, so that they can visit the correct one depending on the material they have to recycle. 

## Area served

Each HWRC has a specific catchment area - and only residents who live within that catchment area are permitted to use the facility. Usually these catchment areas are as simple as a local authority, or a collection of local authorities, but there are circumstances where residents from a particular part of one local authority are permitted to use a HWRC in a neighbouring local authority. These catchment areas can be provided either as a polygon (in shapefile, or geojson, or WKT), or as a list of official geographical areas (ie LSOAs, MSOAs, Wards, Local Authorities).
