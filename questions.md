# Questions for Tom / Sophie / Workshoppers

1. Does every site have an id on environment.data.gov.uk?
In England yes, but lookjng at Wales, Scotland and NI

2. Are all sites the responsibility of a local authority?
Yes, but local authorities are - 

3. Are the local authorities upper or lower tier?
Mish mash

4. Does the approach to publishing make sense? Could Tom elaborate on how he imagines the publishing will work?

LAs have to give data to WRAP and another organisation. But WRAP don't hold data. Tom wants Dsposal to be a data aggregator 


5. Is the area served always a single local authority?
This is very formalised - you can only dispose of waste in the area that you pay tax. Some ANPR. Sometimes some areas can grant permission to other areas to use the tip. This is core / key

6. Services - do we need to build service provision into the specification? eg batteries, electrical goods, radioactive waste etc
OPRL - they want to know whether people can recycle certain things
Jez - OSM integration
WRAP have a list of services - Recycle now
